# Short Bio

Let's embark on my gaming journey from the beginning. I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. From a young age, I immersed myself in the world of gaming, starting with consoles like the Sega Master System and Atari 2600. My passion grew stronger as I delved into educational games and enjoyed classics like Sonic 2, Firo&Klawd, and Duke Nukem 3D. Over time, I explored various genres on multiple platforms.
<br/><br/>
Deep down, I always knew I wanted to pursue a career doing what I loved. However, the gaming industry in Turkey was virtually non-existent, and there were limited opportunities for studying game development. After high school, I chose Software Engineering as the most viable path to enter the gaming industry. I secured a full scholarship at Izmir University of Economics, renowned for its excellence in this field. To my delight, the university introduced a selective game development certification course, allowing me to dive into game development sooner than expected. Throughout my degree, I gained valuable insights, and two of my games even achieved Greenlit status on Steam.
<br/><br/>
Despite my technical skills, I realized my true passion lay in Game Design rather than Game Programming. Determined to pursue my dreams, I enrolled in a Master's Degree in Game Design at Full Sail University in the United States. Shortly before graduation, I landed a position as a Single Player Level Designer at Sledgehammer Games, contributing to Call of Duty World War II. Unfortunately, my work permit expired, forcing me to leave the US.

Upon my return to Turkey, I found myself waiting for the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine. During this time, I became fascinated with building ethereum miners. What started as a small project soon grew into a significant endeavor. I continued building and maintaining mining systems until ethereum mining became less profitable. However, my thoughts started shifting towards returning to my roots in software engineering.
<br/><br/>
In the past few months, I have dedicated myself to studying web development, preparing myself for my next challenge in the software industry. While my love for games remains strong, I have come to terms with the fact that working in the gaming industry may be a thing of the past for me. Nonetheless, I am excited to embark on this new chapter and apply my skills in software engineering to create innovative solutions.
